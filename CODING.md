### Coding Nubilo

* Think about a feature, especially what and why you need it, **BEFORE** implementing it.
* Ask yourself if you REALLY going to need this feature. Every extra line of code may introduce unnecessary 
complexity and bugs.
* If you don't know exactly what a feature will be, try to create a test for it.
* If it is still not clear, try to create tests for sub-aspects of a feature (break it down until it is crystal clear).
* It is ok to let the tests fail - you will know what to do next day! :)
* Keep the code clean and [pythonic](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/)
