Constraints
===========

As it was said before, the main constraint is the weak hardware, which has low power consumption.
We are targeting for the Raspberry Pi Model B, which has:

* Depending on the system configuration, about 
  200-400 MB of free RAM (of 500MB total).
* A 700 MHz ARMv6 processor.
* An external USB HDD drive or NAS connected 
  (as frequent writes to the SD card is no option for a server).
