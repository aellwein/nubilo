   Lua
      A small and lightweight, but fast interpreted programming language. `Lua <http://www.lua.org>`_ can
      also be run using `LuaJIT <http://www.luajit.org>`_ - a just-in-time compiler for Lua. This 
      provides a greater code execution speed (sometimes 50 times faster as its interpreted version). 
      Lua also has a very small memory footprint (the whole Lua interpreter with the
      basic libraries fits in about 200K of RAM).
