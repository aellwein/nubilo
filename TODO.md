# TODO

* integrate menu into dashboard (on side or top - what is better?)

* ~~check if redirect from login works properly~~

* provide facility for auto-bootstrapping the core db (sql script auto-exec,
  much like in bookmarks plugin).
 
* add logging for tracebacks (see traceback package). Needed if e.g. a plugin
  does not load.

* suppress annoying "plugin does have valid structure..."
